        <p class="text-start"><strong>Objective - </strong>It is a null initiative, where people with similar interests in learning new security concepts or domains, come together and prepare a plan to achieve over six months.<br></p>
        <h4 class="text-start">‚úçÔ∏è Detailed&nbsp;<strong>Overview</strong><br></h4>
        <p class="text-start">Generally, study groups run for 6 months, where people with similar interests get together and learn. <br>Participants along with mentors create a plan about what they want to achieve during six months and try to complete the set goals. All the participants will be in communication, using the null Discord Server. Each group will have a dedicated channel associated with them, where they can ask questions, share resources, and mostly have fun learning.<br>There will be periodic calls where every one of us gets together and discusses our doubts, and mentors will also be present for these sessions.&nbsp;<br><br>Few pointers to keep in mind,<br></p>
        <ul class="text-start">
            <li>Preferences will be given to students<br></li>
            <li>Each Study Group will only have 25 participants (which will be selected through filtering), as this will help in a better learning experience.<br></li>
            <li>More people can be added if any seats free up.<br></li>
        </ul>
        <h4 class="text-start">üë©‚Äçüè´ Perks of Having a&nbsp;<strong>Mentor</strong><br></h4>
        <ul class="text-start">
            <li>Mentors are those having industry experience, who will be able to guide you throughout the journey.<br></li>
            <li>Mentors‚Äô help can be taken in setting up goals and objectives.<br></li>
            <li>You can ask questions to the mentors, on how to do something, what to do or why are you doing a certain thing, but not limited to that.<br></li>
        </ul>
        <h4 class="text-start">üôè Code of&nbsp;<strong>Conduct</strong><br></h4>
        <p class="text-start">There are a few rules that one must follow to be part of the study groups,<br></p>
        <ul class="text-start">
            <li>Be nice to each other, and in case of any inconsistency that might lead to elimination from the group.<br></li>
            <li>Be consistent and show your involvement in the group. NO PASSIVE LEARNING IS ALLOWED.<br></li>
            <li>Please do not contact the mentor directly, if you have some problem or question you can put it in the group and tag the mentor and whenever they get time will help you with your query. It will also help others to learn as well.<br></li>
            <li>Please keep note that the mentors will be available on weekends for doubt clearing sessions. And if they get the time they might reply on other days as well.<br></li>
            <li>Please DO NOT share personal contact information with any of the members. All the communications are to be done over Discord(recommended) or emails.<br></li>
            <li>If you are unable to dedicate time, please let the moderators know about it and so that things can proceed easily and that will the moderators in managing things better.<br></li>
            <li>It is not a hand-holding thing, so you'll have to be self-motivated to learn and ask questions.<br></li>
        </ul>
        <h4 class="text-start">ü§ù Benefits after&nbsp;<strong>Completion</strong><br></h4>
        <ul class="text-start">

            <li>We encourage you to talk to the mentor to set up a goal that you want to be completed at the end of the study group that you can showcase in front of the world. It can be in form of an open-source project, blogs, etc.<br></li>
